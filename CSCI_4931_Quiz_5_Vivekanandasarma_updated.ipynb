        "After evaluating my model on the test data for the multi-label classification task, the results suggest that it's moderately effective, but there's significant room for improvement. Notably, the model's accuracy is surprisingly low at 0.0, indicating it's not predicting all the labels for any single sample correctly. This is a known challenge in multi-label classification, where accuracy demands a perfect match of all labels.\n",

        "The micro precision, at 69.48%, shows that a majority of the predicted labels are correct. However, the micro recall is only 22.74%, implying that the model is missing many relevant labels. This is further reflected in the moderate micro F1 score of 34.27%, which balances precision and recall.\n",

        "The discrepancy between precision and recall suggests a conservative model that makes fewer errors in its predictions but overlooks a significant number of correct labels. This could stem from various factors, such as the model's complexity, potential class imbalance in the dataset, or the need for more extensive training. To enhance the model's effectiveness, fine-tuning, and a more in-depth analysis are crucial next steps.\n",

As it is now, its precision and recall was far inferior ot that of the LSTM model with an embedding layer.  \n",
